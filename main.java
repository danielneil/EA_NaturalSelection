# A computational method inspired by the process of natural selection, 
# where certain prey species with a particular color are favored by a predator, is being simulated.

# Randomly generate the initial population of individuals, the first generation.
# Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
# Check, if the goal is reached and the algorithm can be terminated.
# Select individuals as parents, preferably of higher fitness.
# Produce offspring with optional crossover (mimicking reproduction).
# Apply mutation operations on the offspring.
# Select individuals preferably of lower fitness for replacement with new individuals (mimicking natural selection).

# "Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution, first proposed by Charles Darwin. It's a process where organisms 
# with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. 
# Over generations, these advantageous traits become more common within a population, while disadvantageous ones become less so. 
# This gradual change in heritable traits over time leads to the diversity of life we see today."

# Based on the provided description, we'll develop a predator class that shows a preference for "frogs" with a 
# specific color trait. The frog class will subsequently generate offspring that evolve to display a particular color, 
# inheriting it from their parent with minor variations. If the predator's favored color matches the frog's trait, the predator 
# will eliminate that frog instance. A user interface toggle is included to manually adjust the color preference of the predators, 
# thereby vividly demonstrating how the frog population's color distribution is molded by predation.
