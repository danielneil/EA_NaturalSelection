# Randomly generate the initial population of individuals, the first generation.
# Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population.
# Check, if the goal is reached and the algorithm can be terminated.
# Select individuals as parents, preferably of higher fitness.
# Produce offspring with optional crossover (mimicking reproduction).
# Apply mutation operations on the offspring.
# Select individuals preferably of lower fitness for replacement with new individuals (mimicking natural selection).
